  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I've lived almost my entire life in Oregon, in the Portland area. I grew up in Forest Grove and joined an artillery unit in the National Guard shortly after high school. After my deployment to Iraq, I went to PCC for drafting and design. I worked at an engineering consultanting firm that focused on substation design. I quickly made my way up to designer and successfully designed several substation projects from simple equipment changes to entire substations in the middle of the forest. After spending 8 years there I felt I was due for a career change and became a concrete mixer driver in an attempt to re-live my driving experience in Iraq. This was a terrible idea and didn't last long. After a few months into that career, I decided to go back into drafting. I started work at a small business in Clackamas where I supported an architect in designing over-the-top extravant driveway gates. I was enjoying working there because it was a nice mix of time spent at the computer and time spent in the shop. Shortly after Covid-19 started making the news, I ended up getting laid off as the owner was concerned about the lack of gate orders during a pandemic. In the summer of 2020 I started looking into seriously learning programming. I've messed with coding here and there, attempting Unity tutorials on my own, as well as have made simple tools in AutoCAD using AutoLISP and in MicroStation using Visual Basic in MicroStation. I attended one of Epicodus' weekend workshops in October to see if it was right for me and I quickly signed up shortly afterward. I have a friend who completed Epicodus' program. He speaks highly of his time there so I'm looking forward to continuing these courses and working with my peers. In the National Guard, I was an AFATDS Specialist which mostly consisted of coordinating which firing battery would be best for the job based on target and unit location as well as available ordinance. Another key area was providing the information to aim the guns to hit their target. This was primarily done by computer but we also learned how to do it by hand in case the computers went down. I deployed to Iraq for a year in 2009/10 where artillery wasn't needed so my unit operated convoys delivering supplies all over western Iraq. I drove the lead vehicle, an MRAP with a mineroller attachment. Fortunately, I logged over 10,000 miles with out any safety incidents or serious conflict.
