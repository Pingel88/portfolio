              <div class="card-text">
                <p>Currently living in Gresham with my girlfriend (of 8 years) Kourtney, and our 2 cats, Princess Poopy Pants & Duchess Dirty Drawers. I've lived in the Portland area my entire life and while I enjoy traveling, I haven't made it too far from home on my own terms.</p>
                <p>I've always had an interest in programming but have never given myself a fair chance to learn it. I've tried free or cheap online courses but for whatever reason, I find myself getting burnt out regardless of which course I tried. So far, this pair and group programming is an awesome experience. I think the bit of camaraderie you find in the team is what I was missing to push myself.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>My hobbies seem to change faster than the seasons but the last few years I've been spending a lot of time playing Star Wars Galaxies, a defunct Star Wars MMO from 2003 that died in 2010. It's been resurrected by a small team running an emulated private server and I hope to learn something at Epicodus that can help out the community that revolves around the game. I've also been dabbling in 3D printing, where I can put my CAD skills to use.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I enlisted in the Oregon National Guard in 2007 as an AFATDS Specialist where I was trained to do the math needed for artillery guns to hit their target. This was typically done by computer but also had to keep our skills fresh on the manual calculations if the computers went down. The way my unit was structured, my main job became coordinating which firing unit would receive the fire mission based on location, readiness, and available ammo. In 2009, I deployed to Iraq at a time when artillery wasn't needed so we became a convoy unit escorting supplies all over western Iraq. I spent a year driving the lead vehicle, an <a href="img/mineroller.jpg" class="alt-link-color">MRAP with a mineroller attachment</a>, where I logged over 10,000 miles without any safety incidents or serious conflict.</p>

                <div class="card-text">
                  <p>I attended Portland Community College where I took a computer-aided drafting and design course. I learned the fundamentals of drafting and design as well as became proficient in AutoCAD, Solidworks, and Inventor. My first job out of class utilized MicroStation for 3D work which ended up becoming my preferred program after learning through brute force. I've used Solidworks at home to model things for my 3D printer making fun gadgets or functional things around the house. I was also fortunate enough to pick up skills at my last job operating a waterjet. It was a fun learning experience cutting through a few inches of steel with only water.</p>

                <div class="card-text">
                  <p>Most of my professional career revolves around drafting and design. Right after PCC, I spent 8 years at an engineering consulting firm that focused on substation design. I started at the bottom as a drafter that didn't know what a substation was and made my way up to a physical designer where I had my own projects from small equipment replacements to brand new substations larger than a football field. I then worked as a concrete mixer driver for a short period that showed me how great of a career I had. I returned to drafting where I supported an architect in designing extravagant driveway gates which unfortunately only lasted until Covid-19 started making local headlines.</p>
